#  Pro-Tasker - Project & Task Management App

**Pro-Tasker** is a full-stack web application that allows users to create and manage projects and tasks, invite collaborators, and stay organized with a clean, modern interface.

>  This project is my final capstone for the software engineering program. It demonstrates my ability to build and deploy a complete MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack application from scratch, including authentication, REST API, state management, and deployment.
